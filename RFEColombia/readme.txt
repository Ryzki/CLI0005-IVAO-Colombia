Thanks for the interest in using IVAO-US RFE Template.

To setup things, you should do the following:

1) Create two databases in your server (one for RFE data, other for Nav data);
2) Create one user in the SQL and assign all permissions to both databases;
3) Edit func_general.php (in phpinc directory) and change the url variable (line 19) to the address of RFE page;
4) Change the division logos under images/divlogo.

In case of problems, contact me on filipe.fonseca@ivao.aero.

Enjoy!
